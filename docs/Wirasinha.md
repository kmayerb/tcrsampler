The file contains mouse T cell receptor (TCR) sequences collected by multiplex PCR amplification of 
cDNA molecules followed by Illumina sequencing. Sequences were aligned to the mouse genome using MIGEC software 
(see doi: 10.1038/nmeth.2960 for details). 

Except for the header row, each row contains information about a unique TCR nucleotide sequence. 

* Columns 1-11 contain output from MIGEC software. 
* Columns 12-16 contain information about sample origin, detailed as follows: 
  * column 12 "sample_id" is an identifier for the sample of origin; 
  * column 13 "tcr_b" specifies the TCR beta chain status of donor mouse ("poly" = C57BL/6 inbred mouse strain); 
  * column 14 "organ" specifies organ of origin (thymus, "gut" = small intestine and spleen); 
  * column 15 "subset" specifies the T cell subset of origin 
    * "t_p" = pre-selection thymocytes; 
    * "t_1" = wave 1 thymocyte
    * "t_r" = thymic T-reg
    * "t_4" = CD4+ naive thymocytes
    * "t_8" = CD8+ naive thymocytes; 
    * "g8a" = small intestinal CD8aa+ intraepithelial lymphocytes; 
    * "s_r" = splenic T-reg; "s_4" = splenic CD4+ naive T cells and 
    * "s_8" = splenic CD8+ naive T cells); 
  * column 16 is identical to column 15 except that column 16 shows whether the sample of origin was a CD25+ or CD25– fraction of a thymic or splenic T-reg population.
